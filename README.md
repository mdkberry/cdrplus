CDRPlus - Live call stats &amp; reporting software for Asterisk PBX , runs on Windows 7 using php and XAMPP, and pulls MYSQL data from the PBX via port 3306 to then make stats available via browser.

Designer: Mark Berry  
Coding: Canlan318 @ Freelancer.com

SUMMARY:

A live call logging system, updated and viewed via browser using staff names and teams to show call numbers in a live tally, as call totals per day/week/month in graphs that can be set to auto-rotate in the browser window and can therefore be displayed live on an LCD screen in the office or viewed from any network PC.
 
CDRPlus was designed to run on Windows 7 using XAMPP, and access a seperate server running Asterisk PBX to monitor the CDR reports database as it logs calls. Using additional a database on the PC called 'membership' that needs to be manually created and populated when setting up CDRPlus, then the code uses that info to match and calculate calls made over various periods pulled from the PBX asteriskcdrdb call records. This info is then made available via the CDRPlus software and accessible via browser from the network. (Hence it is accessible to all users and can be run on an LCD screen connected to a computer with rotating screens. pretty cool !

There is also a reporting system that can be set to run on a schedule or on demand, and mails out using external mail server if you have access to one. Settings for this need to be added into the relevant php files. There was some attempts to use sendmail settings locally, but not sure if they worked very well.

Updates to databases and records are made via a browser window too, and reports are also possible that run scheduled times or on demand. This is also updated from the browser. Once it is working most tasks can be done from the browser, though new extensions need to be added using phpmyadmin on the PC. 

The main issue with this software is that it has absolutely no security and makes the PBX vulnerable via MYSql access as that port needs to be open. I managed this using very tight firewall control internally on the office network restricting access to the PBX using iptables and logging any attempts on the PBX, but it would be easy to hack internally. I never had a problem as long as only I had admin access to the CDRPlus and PBX machines. 

CDRPLUS version 2.0 is tested on Windows 7 pro 32-bit (virtual) connecting to FreePBX 2.3 (Asterisk 1.8) and Elastix PBX.

I ran this live in a business environment with great success for 2 years, firstly on Elastix and then I moved to FreePBX which handled it a lot better and I felt to be a more robust system than Elastix.

I am opening the software up to the open source community so others can benefit from it and start to work on it to improve it. It is a great design but just needs the security side addressing within the software and also turning into something less manually cumbersome to install.

I will not be updating this personally, but will try to remain available to anyone in the early stages who wants to take on making it more user-friendly in the install stage. There is also the issue of clarity around the database setup that I dont seem to have info on. If you want to get started begin with the Installation Instructions as everything you need should be in there to get going with it. 

I include the PBX build instructions as well as I feel they may help people with problems I ran into when first designing these machines to work together.

FOLDER CONTENTS:  
- Asterisk PBX Build Info  
	This is the Golden Standard PBX build I was working to and may help if anyone runs into PBX build problems. 		I began using Elastix but moved to FreePBX which was better and more stable.
- CDRPlus_Software_Vrs2  
	The software itself in archive form and unpacked into \cdr folder   
	Installation Instructions (start here when you want to get going)
- Database_Stuff  
	Legacy info that may be of use. Mostly ignore it as it probably is not in the current build.
- Design_Specs  
	Some of the design specs I worked with Canlan318 to get vrs 1 and vrs 2 completed. Any problems we ran into later 	would not be reflected here so bear that in mind. It may not be exactly how vrs 2 ended up.
- Early_CDRPlus_Builds    
	again this is for reference and has a lot of the early workings and screenshots. it may help any coder wanting to understand better how it works and the intent behind it. probably not needed but I put it here anyway.
- Program_Screenshots    
	screen shots of the browser, there are more in the Early Builds folder.
- To Do List  
	just my to do list as I left it the last time I looked at updating the software which was in 2013.
