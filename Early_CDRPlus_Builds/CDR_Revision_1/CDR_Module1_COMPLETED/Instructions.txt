This is the first working version of CDR PLus and contains only the module 1.
see notes for install and setup.
this was completed and superceded by full version Feb 2013.

membership.sql needs to be imported via phpmyadmin to the local machine where CDR runs.
this shows the local tables that are used for referencing ext. membername. and dept. 

note that this format changed for the next version of CDR PLus and was no longer applicable.
